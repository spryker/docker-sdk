```

2. Adjust `deploy.*.yml` in the `services:` section to enable Blackfire service:

```yaml
services:
    ...
    blackfire:
        engine: blackfire
```

3. Pass Blackfire client details:

```bash
 BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_ID={client_id} BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_TOKEN={client-token} docker/sdk cli
 ```

4. Pass Blackfire server details:

```bash
BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID={client-token} BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN={server_token} docker/sdk up
```

:::(Warning) (Note)
You can pass the server details only with the `docker/sdk up` command.
:::

5. Bootstrap the docker setup and rebuild the application:
```bash
docker/sdk boot deploy.*.yml &&\
docker/sdk up
```

It is not obligatory to pass all the details as environment variables or define all the details in the deploy file. You can pass the details in any combination.

## New Relic

[New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) is a tool used to track the performance of services and the environment to quickly find and fix issues.

The solution consists of a client and a server. The client is used to collect data about applications in an environment and send it to the server for further analysis and presentation. The server is used to aggregate, analyse, and present the data.

### Prerequisites

* Access to New Relic with an APM account.
* Local: [New Relic license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/).
* The New Relic module.

Spryker provides its own New Relic licenses for use with its PaaS environments. A New Relic license key is only required if you wish to set up your own local monitoring.

### Install the New Relic module

While most environments come with New Relic already available, you may need to add the module to your project. Add the module to your `composer.json`:

```bash
composer require spryker-eco/new-relic
```

### SCCOS: Configure New Relic

1. Adjust `deploy.*.yml` in the `image:` section:

```yaml
image:
    tag: spryker/php:7.4 # the image tag that has been previously used in `image`
    php:
        ...
        enabled-extensions:
            ...
            - newrelic
```

2. Push and deploy the changes using one of the following guides:

  * [Deploying in a staging environment](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/cloud/dev/spryker-cloud-commerce-os/deploying-in-a-staging-environment.html)
  * [Deploying in a production environment](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/cloud/dev/spryker-cloud-commerce-os/deploying-in-a-production-environment.html)



3. Submit an infrastructure change request via the [Support Portal](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/support/how-to-use-the-support-portal.html).
  We will confirm that a New Relic APM account is available for you and ensure that the correct application naming convention is set up to cascade to the appropriate APM.

Once New Relic is enabled, in the New Relic dashboard, you may see either `company-staging-newrelic-app` or `YVES-DE (docker.dev)`. New Relic displays these APM names by the application name setup in the configuration files.

![screenshot](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/drive-viewer/AJc5JmRPsydm6Ds2eRmKS_lMRNjBnqhBLsvtN_ul_R1EMO7Z4pj74Mbpw3kMdAnjH6gIwLt9cvOqLcI=w1920-h919)


{% info_block infoBox %}

If you update the name of an application, [contact support](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/support/how-to-use-the-support-portal.html) to update the changes in your APM.

{% endinfo_block %}



### Local: Configure New Relic

1. In `deploy.*.yml`, adjust the `docker` section:

```yaml
docker:
    newrelic:
        license: {new_relic_license}
    distributed tracing:
            enabled: true
```

2. In the `deploy.*.yml`, adjust the `image` section:

```yaml
image:
    tag: spryker/php:7.4 # the image tag that has been previously used in `image`
    php:
        ...
        enabled-extensions:
            ...
            - newrelic
```

3. Bootstrap the docker setup and rebuild the application:
```bash
docker/sdk boot deploy.*.yml &&\
docker/sdk up
```


### Configure YVES, ZED, and GLUE as separate APMs

By default, in the New Relic dashboard, the APM is displayed as `company-staging-newrelic-app`. To improve visibility, you may want to configure each application as a separate APM. For example, `YVES-DE (docker.dev)`.

To do it, adjust the Monitoring service in `src/Pyz/Service/Monitoring/MonitoringDependencyProvider.php`:  

```php
<?php declare(strict_types = 1);

/**
 * This file is part of the Spryker Commerce OS.
 * For full license information, please view the LICENSE file that was distributed with this source code.
 */

namespace Pyz\Service\Monitoring;

use Spryker\Service\Monitoring\MonitoringDependencyProvider as SprykerMonitoringDependencyProvider;
use SprykerEco\Service\NewRelic\Plugin\NewRelicMonitoringExtensionPlugin;

class MonitoringDependencyProvider extends SprykerMonitoringDependencyProvider
{
    /**
     * @return \Spryker\Service\MonitoringExtension\Dependency\Plugin\MonitoringExtensionPluginInterface[]
     */
    protected function getMonitoringExtensions(): array
    {
        return [
            new NewRelicMonitoringExtensionPlugin(),
        ];
    }
}
```

{% info_block infoBox %}

* Some builds have the Monitoring service built into the Yves application. If `src/Pyz/Service/Monitoring/MonitoringDependencyProvider.php` does not exist, you may want to check `src/Pyz/Yves/Monitoring/`.

* If the class is missing from the Monitoring service, create it.


{% endinfo_block %}



With `new \SprykerEco\Service\NewRelic\Plugin\NewRelicMonitoringExtensionPlugin()` being returned with the `getMonitoringExtensions()` function, the Monitoring class includes New Relic. Now applications are displayed as separate APMs, and an appropriate endpoint or class is displayed with each transaction.

4. Bootstrap the docker setup and rebuild the application:
```bash
docker/sdk boot deploy.*.yml &&\
docker/sdk up
```
