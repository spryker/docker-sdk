# Installing in Demo mode on Windows

This document describes the procedure of installing Spryker in [Demo Mode](01-choosing-an-installation-mode.md#demo-mode) on Windows.

## Installing Docker prerequisites on Windows

To install Docker prerequisites on Windows, follow [Installing Docker prerequisites on Windows](../01-installation-prerequisites/01-installing-docker-prerequisites-on-windows.md)


## Installing Spryker in Demo mode on Windows

Follow the steps to install Spryker in Demo Mode:

1. Open Ubuntu.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Create a new folder and navigate into it.
4. Depending on the desired [Demo Shop](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/about-spryker#spryker-b2b-b2c-demo-shops):

    a. Clone the B2C repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop.git -b 202009.0-p1 --single-branch ./b2c-demo-shop
    ```

    b. Clone the B2B repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop.git -b 202009.0-p1 --single-branch ./b2b-demo-shop
    ```
5. Depending on the cloned repository, navigate into the cloned folder:
    * B2C repository:
    ```bash
    cd b2c-demo-shop
    ```
    * B2B repository:
    ```bash
    cd b2b-demo-shop
    ```
:::(Warning) (Verification)
Make sure that you are in the correct folder by running the `pwd` command.
:::

6. Clone the Docker SDK repository into the same folder:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:spryker/docker-sdk.git --single-branch docker
```
:::(Warning) (Verification)
Make sure `docker 18.09.1+` and `docker-compose 1.23+` are installed:

```bash
$ docker version
$ docker-compose --version
```
:::


7. Add your user to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```


8. Bootstrap the local Docker setup for demo:
```shell
docker/sdk bootstrap
```


:::(Warning) (Bootstrap)
Once you finish the setup, you don't need to run `bootstrap` to start the instance. You only need to run it after:
* Docker SDK version update;
* Deploy file update.
:::
9. Once the job finishes, build and start the instance:
```shell
docker/sdk up
```
10. Update the `hosts` file:
    1. Open the Start menu.
    2. In the search field, enter `Notepad`.
    3. Right-click *Notepad* and select **Run as administrator**.
    4. In the *User Account Control* window, select **Yes** to confirm the action.
    5. In the upper navigation panel, select **File** > **Open**.
    6. Put the following path into the address line: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`.
    7. In the **File name** line, enter `hosts` and select **Open**.
    The hosts file opens in the drop-down.
    8. Follow the installation instructions in the white box from the `docker/sdk bootstrap` command execution results to prepare the environment.
    :::(Info) ()
    You can run `docker/sdk install` after `bootstrap` to get the list of the instructions.
    :::
    9. Select **File** > **Save**.
    10. Close the file.


:::(Warning) ()
Depending on the hardware performance, the first project launch can take up to 20 minutes.
:::

## Endpoints

To ensure that the installation is successful, make sure you can access the configured endpoints from the Deploy file. See [Deploy file reference - 1.0](07-deploy-file/02-deploy-file-reference.v1.md) to learn about the Deploy file.

:::(Info) (RabbitMQ UI credentials)
To access RabbitMQ UI, use `spryker` as a username and `secret` as a password. You can adjust the credentials in `deploy.yml`.
