## Deploy file structure

The topics below are organized alphabetically for top-level keys and sub-level keys to describe the hierarchy.

You can use the extended YAML syntax according to [YAML™ Version 1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).
Find B2B and B2C deploy file examples for [development](../06-installation/02-installation-guides/01-choosing-an-installation-mode#development-mode) and [demo](../06-installation/02-installation-guides/01-choosing-an-installation-mode#demo-mode) environments in the table:

| Development mode | Demo mode |
| --- | --- |
| [B2C Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.dev.yml) | [B2C Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.yml) |

***
### version:

Defines the version of the Deploy file format.

This reference page describes the Deploy file format for versions 1.*.

This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `version: "0.1"`.

```yaml
version: 1.0

namespace: spryker-demo
...
```




***

### namespace:

Defines the namespace to separate different deployments in a single environment.

For example, Docker images, containers and volume names start with a `namespace:` to avoid intersections between different deployments on a single host machine.

This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `namespace: spryker`.

```yaml
version: 1.0
namespace: spryker-demo
```

***

### pipeline:

Defines the installation recipe for the Spryker applications to the specific configuration file from the `config/install/` directory.

This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `pipeline: 'docker'`. Installation recipe configuration file: `config/install/docker.yml`.

***

### tag:

Defines a tag to separate different boots for a single deployment.

By default, the tag is a randomly generated, unique value.

For example, Docker images and volumes are tagged with a `tag:` to avoid intersections between different boots for a signle deployment on a single host machine. The tag can be set directly in the deploy file to ensure that all the boots of a deployment run with the same images and volumes.

This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `tag: '1.0'`.


:::

```yaml
version: 1.0

tag: '1.0'
```
```yaml
version: 1.0

tag: 'custom-one'
```


***

### environment:

Defines the environment name for Spryker applications mainly to point to specific configuration files, namely `config/Shared/config-default_{environment_name}_{store}.php`.

The `APPLICATION_ENV` environment variable is set for all the corresponding Spryker applications.

This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `environment: 'docker'`.

```yaml
version: 1.0

environment: 'docker'
```


***

### imports:

Defines any of the following:

* Imports of additional deploy files to be included into a build. Supports imports of the same deploy file multiple times. To define a deploy file and dynamic parameters for this type of import, see [imports: {import_name}:](#imports-importname).
```yaml
imports:
    {import_name}:
        template: {deploy_file_name}
    {import_name}:
        template: {deploy_file_name}
```

* An array of additional deploy files to be included into a build. Supports imports of the same deploy file multiple times. To define dynamic parameters for this type of import, see [imports: parameters:](#imports-parameters)
```yaml
imports:
    - template: {deploy_file_name}
    - template: {deploy_file_name}
```

The files must exist on a [project or base layer](/docs/scos/dev/the-docker-sdk/{{page.version}}/deploy-file/deploy-file.html).



{% info_block infoBox "Merged deploy files" %}

If you include a deploy file, the included deploy file is merged with the original one. The final deploy file is used to build the application. To check how the final deploy file looks without stopping containers, run `docker config {DEPLOY_FILE_NAME}`. For example, if your main deploy file is `deploy.dev.yml`, run `docker config deploy.dev.yml`. The command parses the included deploy files and returns the merged file and validation errors, if any.

{% endinfo_block %}


***

### imports: parameters:

Defines the [dynamic parameters](/docs/scos/dev/the-docker-sdk/{{page.version}}/deploy-file/deploy-file.html#dynamic-parameters) to be used when parsing the included deploy file. In the included deploy file, the parameter name should be wrapped in `%`.

```yaml
imports:
  - template: {deploy_file_name}
    parameters:
      {dynamic_parameter_name}: '{dynamic_parameter_value}'
      {dynamic_parameter_name}: '{dynamic_parameter_value}'
```

Example:
```yaml
imports:
  - template: deploy.porject.yml
    parameters:
      env-name: 'dev'
      locale: 'en'
```

{% info_block warningBox "" %}

Affects the included deploy file that it follows in an array of included deploy files. To learn how you can add dynamic parameters for other types of imports, see [imports: {import_name}:](#imports-importname) and [imports: {deploy_file_name}:](#imports-deployfilename).

{% endinfo_block %}

***


### imports: {import_name}:

Defines the configuration of the import:
* `{import_name}: template:` — defines the deploy file to be included into a build  as part of this import.
* `{import_name}: parameters:` - defines the [dynamic parameters](/docs/scos/dev/the-docker-sdk/{{page.version}}/deploy-file/deploy-file.html#dynamic-parameters) to be used when parsing the included deploy file. In the included deploy file, the parameter name should be wrapped in `%`.

```yaml
imports:
    {import_name}:
        template: {deploy_file_name}
        parameters:
          {dynamic_parameter_name}: '{dynamic_parameter_value}'
          {dynamic_parameter_name}: '{dynamic_parameter_value}'
```
Example:
```yaml
imports:
    base:
        template: deploy.base.template.yml

        endpoints:
          backoffice.store1.spryker.local:
            store: STORE-1
            services:
              # Application-Store-specific services settings
          backoffice.store2.spryker.local:

```shell
docker/sdk clean-data
```

2. Populate Spryker demo data:
```shell
docker/sdk demo-data
```

#### [CLOUD] Define gateway IP addresses

Note: it's necessary to define gateway IP addresses for AWS to fetch the real IP for `all` defined applications.

```yaml
x-real-ip: &real-ip
    real-ip:
        from:
            - 10.0.0.0/8 # AWS VPC network

x-frontend-auth: &frontend-auth
    <<: *real-ip

groups:
    EU:
        region: EU
        applications:
            boffice:
                application: backoffice
                endpoints:
                    backoffice.de.spryker.com:
                        store: DE
                        primal: true
                        <<: *frontend-auth
                    backoffice.at.spryker,com:
                        store: AT
                        <<: *frontend-auth
            Yves:
                application: yves
                endpoints:
                    www.de.spryker.com:
                        store: DE
                        <<: *frontend-auth
                    www.at.spryker.com:
                        store: AT
                        <<: *frontend-auth
            ...
```

#### Define allowlisted IP addresses

* `docker: maintenance: whitelist: ips:` - defines the allowlisted IP addresses or a CIDR IP from which the applications in the maintenance mode can be accessed.

```yaml
version: 1.0

docker:
    maintenance:
        enabled: true
        whitelist:
          ips:
              - { IP address 1 }
              - { IP address 2 }
              ...
 ```
Now you can access the applications from the `{ IP address 1 }` and `{ IP address 2 }` IP addresses.



### docker: logs:
* `docker: logs: path:` defines the path to the directory with Docker logs. This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `path: '/var/log/spryker`.


***
### docker: testing:

* `docker: testing: store:` defines a *Store* as the context for running tests using specific console commands, like `docker/sdk console code:test`. This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `store: DE`.

:::
***

### docker: mount:

Defines the mode for mounting source files into application containers.

1. `baked:`- source files are copied into the image, so they cannot be changed from host machine. This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `baked:baked`.
2. `native:`- source files are mounted from host machine into containers directly. We recommend using it Linux.
3. `docker-sync:`- source files are synced from host machine into containers during runtime. Use it as a workaround solution with MacOS and Windows.
4.  `mutagen:`- source files are synced from the host machine into running containers. Use it as a workaround for MacOS and Windows.

`As mount:` is a platform-specific setting. You can define multiple mount modes. Use the`platforms:` list to define a mount mode for a platform. Possible platforms are `windows`, `macos`, and `linux`.

The first mount mode matching the host platform is selected by default.
```yaml
version: 1.0

docker:
  mount:
    native:
      platforms:
        - linux
        mutagen:
            platforms:
                - macos
    docker-sync:
      platforms:
        - windows

 ```
 ***

### composer:

Defines the composer settings to be used during deployment.

1. `mode:` - defines whether packages should be installed from the  `require` or `require-dev` section of `composer.json`. Possible values are `--no-dev` and `-dev`. This variable is optional. If not specified, the default values apply:
	* [Development mode]: `mode: --dev`
	* [Demo mode]: `mode: --no-dev`
2. `autoload:` - defines composer autoload options. Possible values are `--optimize` and `--classmap-authoritative`. This variable is optional. If not specified, the default values apply:
