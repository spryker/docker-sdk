# Deploy file reference — version 1



This reference page describes version 1 of the Deploy file format. This is the newest version.
<div class="bg-section">
<h2> Glossary</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Deploy file</dt>
 <dd>A YAML file defining Spryker infrastructure and services for Spryker tools used to deploy Spryker applications in different environments.</dd>

 <dt>Region</dt>
 <dd>Defines one or more isolated instances of Spryker applications that have only one persistent database to work with; limits the visibility of a project's <i>Stores</i> to operate only with the <i>Stores</i> that belong to a <i>Region</i>; refers to geographical terms like data centers, regions and continents in the real world.</dd>

 <dt>Group</dt>
 <dd>Defines a group of Spryker applications within a <i>Region</i> that is scaled separately from other groups; can be assumed as an auto scaling group in the Cloud.</dd>

 <dt>Store</dt>
 <dd>A store related context a request is processed in.</dd>

 <dt>Application</dt>
 <dd>A Spryker application, like Backoffice(Zed), Backend-Gateway, Yves, GlueStorefront(Glue), GlueBackend or MerchantPortal.</dd>

 <dt>Service</dt>
 <dd>An external storage or utility service. Represents service type and configuration. The configuration can be defined on different levels: project-wide, region-wide, store-specific or endpoint-specific with limitations based on the service type.</dd>

 <dt>Endpoint</dt>
 <dd>A point of access to <i>Application</i> or <i>Service</i>. The key format is <code>domain[:port]</code>. By default, the port for HTTP endpoints is 80 . Port is mandatory for TCP endpoints.</dd>

## Deploy file structure

The topics below are organized alphabetically for top-level keys and sub-level keys to describe the hierarchy.

You can use the extended YAML syntax according to [YAML™ Version 1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).
Find B2B and B2C deploy file examples for [development](06-installation/installation-guides/choosing-an-installation-mode#development-mode) and [demo](06-installation/installation-guides/choosing-an-installation-mode#demo-mode) environments in the table:

| Development mode | Demo mode |
| --- | --- |
| [B2C Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.dev.yml) | [B2C Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.yml) |
| [B2B Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.dev.yml) | [B2B Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.yml) |


***
### version:

Defines the version of the Deploy file format.

This reference page describes the Deploy file format for versions 1.*.

This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `version: "0.1"`.

```yaml
version: 1.0

namespace: spryker-demo
...
```




***

### namespace:

Defines the namespace to separate different deployments in a single environment.

For example, Docker images, containers and volume names start with a `namespace:` to avoid intersections between different deployments on a single host machine.

This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `namespace: spryker`.

```yaml
version: 1.0
namespace: spryker-demo
```

***

### pipeline:

Defines the installation recipe for the Spryker applications to the specific configuration file from the `config/install/` directory.

This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `pipeline: 'docker'`. Installation recipe configuration file: `config/install/docker.yml`.

***

### tag:

Defines a tag to separate different boots for a single deployment.

By default, the tag is a randomly generated, unique value.

For example, Docker images and volumes are tagged with a `tag:` to avoid intersections between different boots for a signle deployment on a single host machine. The tag can be set directly in the deploy file to ensure that all the boots of a deployment run with the same images and volumes.

This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `tag: '1.0'`.


:::

```yaml
version: 1.0

tag: '1.0'
```
```yaml
version: 1.0

tag: 'custom-one'
```


***

### environment:

Defines the environment name for Spryker applications mainly to point to specific configuration files, namely `config/Shared/config-default_{environment_name}_{store}.php`.

The `APPLICATION_ENV` environment variable is set for all the corresponding Spryker applications.

This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `environment: 'docker'`.

```yaml
version: 1.0

environment: 'docker'
```


***

### imports:

Defines additional deploy files to be included into a build. The files must exist on a [project or base layer](/01-deploy-file.md).

```yaml
version: 1.0

imports:
    deploy.base.template.yml:
```

{% info_block infoBox "Merged deploy files" %}

If you include a deploy file, the included deploy file is merged with the original one. The final deploy file is used to build the application. To check how the final deploy file looks without stopping containers, run `docker config {DEPLOY_FILE_NAME}`. For example, if your main deploy file is `deploy.dev.yml`, run `docker config deploy.dev.yml`. The command parses the included deploy files and returns the merged file and validation errors, if any.

{% endinfo_block %}


***

### imports: {deploy_file_name}:

Defines the configuration to be used when parsing the included deploy file.
* `{deploy_file_name}: parameters:` - defines the [dynamic parameters](01-deploy-file.md#dynamic-parameters) to be used when parsing the included deploy file. In the included deploy file, the parameter name should be wrapped in `%`.

```yaml
version: 1.0

imports:
    {deploy_file_name}:
      parameters:
        {dynamic_parameter_name}: '{dynamic_parameter_value}'
```
Example:

```yaml
version: 1.0

imports:
    deploy.base.template.yml:
      parameters:
        env_name: 'dev'
```

***

### image:

Defines the Docker image configuraion to run Spryker applications in.

***
### image:tag

Defines the image tag according to the `spryker/php` images located at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/spryker/php/tags).


This variable is optional. If not specified, the default value applies: `image: spryker/php:7.3`.

```yaml
version: 1.0

image:
    tag: spryker/php:7.3
```



***
### image: environment:

Defines additional environment variables for Spryker applications.

```yaml
version: 1.0

        application: backoffice
        endpoints:
          backoffice.store1.spryker.local:
            store: STORE-1
            services:
              # Application-Store-specific services settings
          backoffice.store2.spryker.local:
            store: STORE-2
            services:

        application: merchant-portal
        endpoints:
          mp.store1.spryker.local:
            store: STORE-1
            services:
              # Application-Store-specific services settings
          mp.store2.spryker.local:
            store: STORE-2
            services:
              # Application-Store-specific services settings
  STOREFRONT-1:
    region: REGION-1
    applications:
      yves_1:
        application: yves
        endpoints:
          yves.store1.spryker.local:
            store: STORE-1

            store: STORE-1
          glue.store2.spryker.local:
            store: STORE-2

 ```

Applications can be defined as *Store*-agnostic, as in the example above. Also, applications can be defined as *Store*-specific by leaving a single endpoint pointing to each application. You can see it in the example below. You can use both approaches to scale applications separately by *Store*.
```yaml
version: "1.0"

groups:
  BACKEND-1:
    region: REGION-1
    applications:
      backoffice_store_1:
        application: backoffice
        endpoints:
          backoffice.store1.spryker.local:
            store: STORE-1
      backoffice_store_2:
        application: backoffice
        endpoints:
          backoffice.store2.spryker.local:
            store: STORE-2

 ```

After changing a service version, make sure to re-import demo data:
1. Remove all Spryker volumes:
```shell
docker/sdk clean-data
```

2. Populate Spryker demo data:
```shell
docker/sdk demo-data
```
:::
